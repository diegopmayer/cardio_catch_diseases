<h3>My Purpose</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a machine learning solution to better prediction and automatic then</li>
        <li>We will make a three sprints, each sprints will be execute in one week</li>
        <li>We will began on September 14 and we will delivery solution on October 8</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Collect data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset">Kaggle</a>, where is available dataset in csv format</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Metrics</h4>
    <li>For evaluation you will use the recall, because the recall will be identify the true positive, because it's more important you have wrong prediction with false diseases than false no diseases, because false no disease it's so danger to pacient<lip
    <li>For Business you will use the precision to give the revenue 500 reals with each 5% of precision</li>
